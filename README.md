### Findings based 5 deliverables
The Challenge consisted of 6 components. Here is the list of findings/ outputs of first 5 deliverables.

2. Montgomery High School is the largest population of students
3. The average math score among students is 64.7, reading score is 72.4
4. The scores are in the range of 3 to 100, thus we could not identify global outliers
